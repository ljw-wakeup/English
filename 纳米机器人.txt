Hello, everyone.Today,we are going to introduce a branch in biotechnology
to you. As you see, it is the Nano Medical Robot.

Our presentation will be divided into four parts. They are the GENERAL
INTRODUACTION, DIFFRENT ROBOTS, THE KEY TECHNOLOGY, 
ABOUT FUTURE AND PHILOSPPHY.

 I am going to show the first part -general 
introduction to you.


The science of future is nothing more than continuing to march to the 
macro-world and the micro-world. Albert Enstein once said.

So ,let's step into one of the micro-world in biological field:
NANO MEDICAL ROBOT.

Richard Feynman, the Nobel laureate and the theoretical physicist pineered 
the idea of nanotechnology.
He once said:"Humans will be apply the robots in Nanometer level
to the medical field.
 
With the development of the secience and technology, his ideas are coming
true gradully.
 
So what is the definition of the Nano medical robot?
The Nano medical robot is a micro robot which is consist of thousands of
mechanical parts, operated with program, entering the human body 
to complete some appointed tasks.

Oh lets see the picture.It show the inner structures of the robot.
I will introduce one by one.
THE HEAD
It’s head is a micro-camera, which is used to follow up a discovery.
PAYLOAD
It is something carried by this micro robot, 
usually some medicine or some special materials
CAPACITOR
It is used to provide energy for the tail or arms. 
SWIMMING TAIL
The micro robot is moved by the swimming tail.
But now, there are many new methods like using ultrasonic .


so what dose they do?
they can find out the cancer cell or the virus and then kill them .
and they may become a cleaner to clean the redundant fat in vessel.
Sometimes, they carry some special material and change tne components 
in cells instead of destroy them. When they do their task, they always
disguise as the normal cells in order to keep themselves safe.
