## 写作方法论

#### 方法一： 多理由展开法

开头段表明自己的立场（支持/反对），然后正文用2-4个平行的理由支持自己的立场

**注意事项**

各个理由之间要有明显区别，否则段内展开的细节很难说出不同，导致文章累赘。（根据评分标准，累赘不可取）

##### 限时练习(论点+简单例子思考练习)

**Topic** *All teachers in school should upgrade their knowledge and expertise every 5 years.*

yes

1.The essence of the teacher's work**(occupation)** is passing on the correct knowledge and some methods suitable for today's age. **(Being responsible for students requires that teachers continually update their knowledge and expertise)** With the knowledge changing over time, the teacher can hardly handle the latest and correct knowledge and expertise without the upgrade.

>  computer network class -> point out the difference knowledge points between and classical textbook and actual application in today's world. -> The causes of such a difference behind it impressed me ->  do a intern in a network laboratory -> a problem confuse me -> what my professor told just jump out at me-> solve the problem

2.Upgrading**(refreshing)** the knowledge and expertise like applying a new education methods and using advanced equipment will improve the quality of the education, expressing more clearly and more vividly and raising the efficiency.

> My mother is a history teacher in high school -> share her experience -> In a training program, learn some new and novel methods of teaching -> collect and select some documentaries to play in class instead of telling some historical stories in oral  way-> organize students in groups to search some material focused on one topic -> increase the class participation -> arouse students's interest.

3.Teachers themselves will benefit from the update**(renew)** of their knowledge system, which can train their logical thinking and ability of accepting new knowledge, keeping them competitive in their academic career.

> The academic career are less stable than it used to be -> My uncle used to teach in a university -> He just repeat the old stuffs year by year -> have no thesis published -> students lose interest in his class -> he lost enthusiasm in teaching himself without the sense of achievement -> lose competition in colleague -> be fired by school

问题：第二点中的运用新方法和新设备算不算knowledge and expertise

例子合不合理，够不够细节。（只写了大概的）

**Topic** *

#### 方法二  2+1展开法

正文用两个段落支持自己的立场，用一个段落支持对立的立场。

结尾再次表态，说因为某方理由占据优势，所以选择该方立场

---

#### 方法三 绝对词展开法

这种方法适合题干中出现了极端词，绝对词，比如always, never, only, most, best。

通常文章一开头表明自己的立场（不应该绝对化）

正文第一段承认话题立场的合理性，并充分展开。

第二段指出这个观点如果极端化会遇到的问题，并充分展开。

---

#### 方法四 平衡展开法

如果两个选择明显不互斥，而且两个选择都很重要，那么就选择平衡写法。

开头就表明立场（二者皆很重要）

正文两段，分别从两个方面来写，充分展开。

---

#### 方法五 分情况讨论展开法

从根本上看，每个话题都可以放入不同的情况，具体问题具体分析。

通常文章开篇表明立场（一边倒的立场或者视情况而定的立场）

正文每个自然段讨论一个具体的情况。

常见的情况分类诸如：

不同的行业（科研，商业，艺术）

不同的场合（学校，工作，家里）

不同的年龄（小孩，成年人，老人）

不同的国家（发达国家，发展中国家（难!））

---

#### 方法六，让步转折展开法

解题思路：分别站在正反方思考最核心的理由

选择攻击正方或者反方的理由。

正文首段：先提出己方的观点

次段，提出对立观点的核心理由并反驳

**次段示例**

*Topic* parent shouldn't make decisions for children.

> However, some people, mostly parents, believe that adults' interference can help their children avoid making mistakes, since they believe adult's judgment is more reliable. Unfortunately, with the constant change in today's world, parents' knowledge usually falls out of step, and as a consequence their presumed wisdom sometimes backfires.

> interference /ˌɪntɚ'fɪrəns/  干涉，干预
>
> constant  /'kɑnstənt/ 不断的，连续发生的
>
> falls out of step 跟不上时代，步调不一致
>
> presumed wisdom 认为的智慧，假定的智慧
>
> backfire vi 产生事与愿违的后果

### 限时训练（例子）

*Topic: Government should spend more money on economic development than on environmental protection*

方法：多理由展开

1. The measures of the environmental protection will decrease the health problems**(reduce the risk of health problems )** among people, which can improve **(improving, boosting, promoting)** the ~~happy degree~~ **(happiness)**of citizen.
2. One place with good environment which is suitable for dwelling can attract more people to settle, which will stimulate the economic development for increasing labor resource**(labor force)** and consuming ability.
3. Environmental protection are ~~benefit~~ **(beneficial)** to other hosts of the earth, the animals, for making a more friendly environment with less pollution will decrease their morality rate and save the distinct animals.

*Topic: Governments should spend more money on higher education than on primary education.*

方法：让步转折展开

1. Higher education play a large role in cultivating the talents and experts in all kinds of fields, which require more financial support to establish some big libraries and build a good environmental suitable to study and research for students and professors.
2. An advanced equipment and sufficient experimental material can boost research quality and improve the efficiency, whose outcomes are meaningful and vital to society and science world, requiring more cost.
3. However, some people may think that primary education like intelligent development are at the same important, which require money to hiring better teachers. Unfortunately, I believe it is the ability of collaboration, the capability of communication and the cultivation of the enthusiasm of science are more important, which should be conducted in the improvement of methods of education in family and school. And such kind of training don't need so much money and extra teachers.

*Topic: There is no good reason to be impolite to another person*

*Topic: It is often not a good thing to move to a new city or a new country because of the loss of old friends*

*Topic: Creativity rather than careful planning often results in the best solution.*
